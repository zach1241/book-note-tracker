**Book Note Tracker** is a full-stack CRUD application that lets you record and organize notes on books you’ve read.  
It integrates the **Open Library API** to fetch real book covers and uses **PostgreSQL** to store your notes, ratings, and reviews.  
Built with **Node.js, Express.js, EJS**, and **Axios**, this project is a capstone demonstrating real-world skills in API integration, backend development, and database management.
